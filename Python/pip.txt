pip install Django pip list
This command installs the latest version of Django creating a virtual environment 

Running this command a second time outputs this error:

Requirement already satisfied: Django in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages


So running it a second time tells you that it is already installed and the location of the installation.

pip list lists everything, and pip freeze installs everything installed by pip

When you give the command on the desktop:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

The result is a new file in the local directory called “requirements.txt” and inside is a list of all of the versions of associated programs.
