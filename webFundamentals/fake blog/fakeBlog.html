        <h3>BIO</h3>
        <p>There are a ton of misconceptions out there about me. For instance, my God-given name is Bane. I swear to God. I know its a cool name... and I'm a very cool guy, but total coincidence. I was born in the English Countryside. Everyone thinks I was born in a jail found in a not-so-pleasant part of the world but I was not. That is made semi-clearly in the movie I'm in. While it did explain that The League of Shadows daughter was actually the one in the story told about the kid born in a jail, it did not explicitly say that I was not born in a jail. But, I was born in a hospital and did not even get into any trouble until I was 8. At 8, life changed. I discovered that the world is flawed when I saw a bird fly into a window. And once I form an opinion, even I cannot change it. So I set out to wreak havoc and upper-decked the toilet in the teacher's bathroom. I didn't dislike my teachers... I just knew something was wrong with the world. So I made something wrong in the toilet. People also think I am a gym nut. Also false. The MEDICINE (its not venom) produced by my mask has three side effects. One, it covers my mouth making eating very difficult. Two, it has a lot of moving parts and some have electrical components so it makes drinking and being in the rain next to impossible. Third, my strength does not come from working out. The largest muscle I exercise is my brain. I am too smart for my own good some DO say. Its my medicine. Its positive side effect is producing wicked power. Last unclear thing about me... many wonder why a 'crazy and self-obsessed' criminal would put his life on the line for a little girl he knew nothing about. Well, that is because I did know one thing about her. What you did not see in the film was that there are 4 xboxes system-linked in that jail. That little girl was the best fucking Halo 1 player I've ever come across. And guess who loves Halo 1? Me. So guess who had personal interest in making sure a little girl/doubles partner wasn't harmed? Me. Welcome to my site. Here is a list of just some of my hobbies in no particular order:</p>

        <p>Yes.. you guessed it. Those are my average <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">HALO 1</span> kills I achieved per game vs average amount of times Bane died over the course of a years time. I was a beast. I swear those are my stats.</p>

            <p>But for now. If you are reading this. Take <strong>as long as it takes</strong> to fill out the survey at the bottom. I guess I could include a link to a video on youtube of some random weakling playing cool guitar songs I very much enjoy</p>
